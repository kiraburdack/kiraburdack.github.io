		<!--main content goes here-->
		<article class="item">
		<h2>transportation</h2>
		<h3><i>(trans-port-ay-shon)</i></h3>
		<br>
		<img src="transportation.png" alt="image of clouds being pushed by wind">
		<p>Transportation is when the wind blows clouds from one place to another.</p>
		<p>This moves the water within the clouds to another location.</p>
</article>
<article class="item">
		<h2>runoff</h2>
		<h3><i>(run-off)</i></h3>
		<br>
		<img src="runoff.png" alt="image of river surrounded by grass and small mountains in the distance">
		<p>Runoff is water that runs across a surface. It is usually caused by rain or melted snow.</p>
		<p>You can see runoff as the water in gutters, streams, and rivers.</p>
</article>
<article class="item">
		<h2>infiltration</h2>
		<h3><i>(in-fil-tray-shon)</i></h3>
		<br>
		<img src="infiltration.png" alt="image of a puddle of water with arrows indicating the water moving into the surface of the soil">
		<p>Infiltration is how water seeps into the surface of the ground.</p>
		<p>An example of infiltration would be when puddles get soaked up, keeping the surface dirt moist.</p>
</article>
<article class="item">
		<h2>percolation</h2>
		<h3><i>(per-kol-ay-shon)</i></h3>
		<br>
		<img src="percolation.png" alt="image of small amounts of water which follow the arrows indicating towards a stream of groundwater.">
		<p>Percolation is when water filters through the ground itself.</p>
	<p>Percolation lets water move deeper underground to places where groundwater is.</p>
</article>
<article class="item">
		<h2>groundwater</h2>
		<h3><i>(ground-water)</i></h3>
		<br>
		<img src="groundwater.png" alt="an image of several streams of groundwater connecting to eachother">
		<p>Groundwater is the underground version of rivers and streams.</p>
		<p> They hold water that has gone underground and moves to other areas under the surface.</p>
		<p>Visible groundwater can come from places like caves, springs, and geysers.</p>
</article>
<article class="item">
		<h2>plant uptake</h2>
		<h3><i>(plant-up-take)</i></h3>
		<br>
		<img src="plant uptake.png" alt="an image of a plant's roots in the ground, the arrows indicating how the water in the soil is taken through the roots">
		<p>Plant uptake is when plants absorb water in the ground through their roots.</p>
		<p>Most of the water collected is released back into the air by the plant after some time.</p>
